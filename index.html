        <p class="lead">I’ve always had a knack for creative things. As a kid you could find me designing clothes in Microsoft Paint or creating PowerPoint presentations for my dad's work. I am a classic example of a child growing up as the digital age was gaining speed and allowing me to express my creativity. While I didn’t become a fashion designer, I found ways to turn my love of art, technology and people into a career with social media.</p>

      <p>I believe we are hardwired for connection. We need and crave it to live a happy life. I love the interaction social media allows me to have with the world, even people thousands of miles away.</p>

      <h3>My Story</h3>

        <p>I’m a Midwestern girl who made the leap to Utah when my husband took a new job in 2013. (He’s at MX and I hear you guys will be neighbors soon!)</p>

        <p>I got started in social media around 2011 by building my own brand, Thrift Simply, on Facebook. I built a community of over 1,200 people where kids items were bought and sold in a garage sale style group - back before garage sale groups were a thing.</p>

        <p>After moving to Provo, I worked with the children’s moccasin company, <a href="http://freshly-picked.com/">Freshly Picked</a>. I managed Pinterest and Facebook through the national attention that their appearance on <a href="abc.go.com/shows/shark-tank/episode-guide/season-05/515-swimzip-fitdeck-lifecaps-freshly-picked">ABC’s Shark Tank</a> brought. I averaged 1000 new followers each week on Pinterest alone. I loved putting my creative skills to work in the fast paced world of a startup company.</p>

        <p>Most recently I’ve been at <a href="http://www.silhouetteamerica.com/">Silhouette America</a> managing all of the social channels as well as the affiliate program. I work to boost Silhouette’s social platforms and have seen the results pay off as the numbers continually grow. I also work directly with bloggers, companies, and online influencers who are a part of our affiliate program. A large part of the job is staying in tune with the customer’s feedback and responding to customer’s appropriately while passing the feedback on to the team. I’ve become the go-to employee who sees the whole picture of our customer’s point of view. I’ve enjoyed the challenges of working with a software/electronics company as well as curating well-formed content showing off DIY/crafting projects.</p>

        <p>A while back, <a href="https://www.pinterest.com/megancrow/">my personal profile</a> caught Pinterest’s eye and a community manager contacted me to become a Pinfluencer. I am now a part of the Pinfluencer community where we give product feedback and test beta functions.</p>

        <h3>About You</h3>
        <p>You offer shoppers and sellers a unique marketplace featuring the latest goods. You allow customers to shop from the convenience of their phones so they never miss a deal. You want to continue putting the customer first while meeting the needs of the sellers.  You’ve got a great handle on your social channels and need to continue to find new ways to stay ahead of the curve.</p>

        <p>You need someone comfortable working in the fast pace of social media and with a knack for monitoring the pulse of the company.</p>

        <p><strong>I’m that girl.</strong></p>

        <p>I didn’t apply for this job lightly. I want to work for a company that inspires me and with people I can learn from. I will put my knowledge to work for you and see the results pay off.</p>

        <p><strong>Let's talk and make this happen.</strong></p>
